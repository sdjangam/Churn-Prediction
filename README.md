# Churn-Prediction
Customers of a big international bank decided to leave the bank. The bank is investigating a very high rate of customer leaving the bank. The dataset contains 10000 records, and we use it to investigate and predict which of the customers are more likely to leave the bank soon. The approach here is supervised classification; the classification model to be built on historical data and then used to predict the classes for the current customers to identify the churn. The dataset contains 13 features, and also the label column (Exited or not). The best accuracy was obtained with the Na√Øve Bayes model (83.29%). Such churn prediction models could be very useful for applications such as churn prediction in Telecom sector to identify the customers who are switching from current network, and also for Churn prediction in subscription services.
